== Cluster Operator

The Cluster Operator is in charge of deploying a Kafka cluster alongside a Zookeeper ensemble. As part of the Kafka cluster,
it can also deploy the topic operator which provides operator-style topic management via ConfigMaps.
The Cluster Operator is also able to deploy a Kafka Connect cluster which connects to an existing Kafka cluster.
On {OpenShiftName} such a cluster can be deployed using the Source2Image feature, providing an easy way of including more connectors.

image::cluster_operator.png[Cluster Operator]

When the Cluster Operator is up, it starts to "watch" for ConfigMaps containing the Kafka or Kafka Connect
cluster configuration. Such ConfigMaps need to have a specific label which is, by default, `strimzi.io/kind=cluster`
(as described <<Format of the cluster ConfigMap,later>>) that can be changed through a corresponding environment variable.

When a new ConfigMap is created in {ProductPlatformName} cluster, the operator gets the cluster configuration from
its `data` section and starts creating a new Kafka or Kafka Connect cluster by creating the necessary {ProductPlatformName}
resources, such as StatefulSets, ConfigMaps, Services etc.

Every time the ConfigMap is updated by the user with some changes in the `data` section, the operator performs corresponding
updates on the {ProductPlatformName} resources which make up the Kafka or Kafka Connect cluster. Resources are either patched
or deleted and then re-created in order to make the Kafka or Kafka Connect cluster reflect the state of the cluster ConfigMap.
This might cause a rolling update which might lead to service disruption.

Finally, when the ConfigMap is deleted, the operator starts to un-deploy the cluster deleting all the related {ProductPlatformName}
resources.

=== Reconciliation

Although the operator reacts to all notifications about the cluster ConfigMaps received from the {ProductPlatformName} cluster,
if the operator is not running, or if a notification is not received for any reason, the ConfigMaps will get out of sync
with the state of the running {ProductPlatformName} cluster.

In order to handle failovers properly, a periodic reconciliation process is executed by the Cluster Operator so
that it can compare the state of the ConfigMaps with the current cluster deployment in order to have
a consistent state across all of them.

[[config_map_details]]
=== Format of the cluster ConfigMap

The operator watches for ConfigMaps having the label `strimzi.io/kind=cluster` in order to find and get
configuration for a Kafka or Kafka Connect cluster to deploy.

In order to distinguish which "type" of cluster to deploy, Kafka or Kafka Connect, the operator checks the
`strimzi.io/type` label which can have one of the the following values :

* `kafka`: the ConfigMap provides configuration for a Kafka cluster (with Zookeeper ensemble) deployment
* `kafka-connect`: the ConfigMap provides configuration for a Kafka Connect cluster deployment
* `kafka-connect-s2i`: the ConfigMap provides configuration for a Kafka Connect cluster deployment using Build and Source2Image
features (works only with {OpenShiftName})

Whatever other labels are applied to the ConfigMap will also be applied to the {ProductPlatformName} resources making
up the Kafka or Kafka Connect cluster. This provides a convenient mechanism for those resource to be labelled
in whatever way the user requires.

The `data` section of such ConfigMaps contains different keys depending on the "type" of deployment as described in the 
following sections.

The resources created by the Cluster Operator into the {ProductPlatformName} cluster will be the following :

* `[cluster-name]-zookeeper` StatefulSet which is in charge to create the Zookeeper node pods
* `[cluster-name]-kafka` StatefulSet which is in charge to create the Kafka broker pods
* `[cluster-name]-zookeeper-headless` Service needed to have DNS resolve the Zookeeper pods IP addresses directly
* `[cluster-name]-kafka-headless` Service needed to have DNS resolve the Kafka broker pods IP addresses directly
* `[cluster-name]-zookeeper` Service used by Kafka brokers to connect to Zookeeper nodes as clients
* `[cluster-name]-kafka` Service can be used as bootstrap servers for Kafka clients
* `[cluster-name]-zookeeper-metrics-config` ConfigMap which contains the Zookeeper metrics configuration and mounted as
a volume by the Zookeeper node pods
* `[cluster-name]-kafka-metrics-config` ConfigMap which contains the Kafka metrics configuration and mounted as
a volume by the Kafka broker pods

[[kafka_configuration_json_config]]
===== Kafka Configuration

The `kafka-config` field allows detailed configuration of Apache Kafka. This field should contain a JSON object with Kafka
configuration options as keys. The values could be in one of the following JSON types:

* String
* Number
* Boolean

The `kafka-config` field supports all Kafka configuration options with the exception of options related to:

* Security (Encryption, Authentication and Authorization)
* Listener configuration
* Broker ID configuration
* Configuration of log data directories
* Inter-broker communication
* Zookeeper connectivity

Specifically, all configuration options with keys starting with one of the following strings will be ignored:

* `listeners`
* `advertised.`
* `broker.`
* `listener.`
* `host.name`
* `port`
* `inter.broker.listener.name`
* `sasl.`
* `ssl.`
* `security.`
* `password.`
* `principal.builder.class`
* `log.dir`
* `zookeeper.connect`
* `zookeeper.set.acl`
* `authorizer.`
* `super.user`

All other options will be passed to Kafka. A list of all the available options can be found on the
http://kafka.apache.org/11/documentation.html#brokerconfigs[Kafka website]. An example `kafka-config` field is provided
below.

  "socket.request.max.bytes": 104857600,
  "group.initial.rebalance.delay.ms": 0
}
----

NOTE:: The Cluster Operator doesn't validate the provided configuration. When invalid configuration is provided, the
Kafka cluster might not start or might become unstable. In such cases, the configuration in the `kafka-config` field
should be fixed and the cluster operator will roll out the new configuration to all Kafka brokers.

[[zookeeper_configuration_json_config]]
===== Zookeeper Configuration

The `zookeeper-config` field allows detailed configuration of Apache Zookeeper. This field should contain a JSON object
with Zookeeper configuration options as keys. The values could be in one of the following JSON types:

* String
* Number
* Boolean

The `zookeeper-config` field supports all Zookeeper configuration options with the exception of options related to:

* Security (Encryption, Authentication and Authorization)
* Listener configuration
* Configuration of data directories
* Zookeeper cluster composition

Specifically, all configuration options with keys starting with one of the following strings will be ignored:

* `server.`
* `dataDir`
* `dataLogDir`
* `clientPort`
* `authProvider`
* `quorum.auth`
* `requireClientAuthScheme`

All other options will be passed to Zookeeper. A list of all the available options can be found on the
http://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.4.12/zookeeperAdmin.html[Zookeeper website]. An example `zookeeper-config` field is provided
below.

.Example Zookeeper configuration
[source,json]
----
{
  "timeTick": 2000,
  "initLimit": 5,
  "syncLimit": 2,
  "quorumListenOnAllIPs": true,
  "maxClientCnxns": 0,
  "autopurge.snapRetainCount": 3,
  "autopurge.purgeInterval": 1
}
----

Selected options have default values:

* `timeTick` with default value `2000`
* `initLimit` with default value `5`
* `syncLimit` with default value `2`
* `autopurge.purgeInterval` with default value `1`

These options will be automatically configured in case they are not present in the `zookeeper-config` field.

NOTE:: The Cluster Operator doesn't validate the provided configuration. When invalid configuration is provided, the
Zookeeper cluster might not start or might become unstable. In such cases, the configuration in the `zookeeper-config` field
should be fixed and the cluster operator will roll out the new configuration to all Zookeeper nodes.

[[storage_configuration_json_config]]
===== Storage

Both Kafka and Zookeeper save data to files.

{ProductName} allows to save such data in an "ephemeral" way (using `emptyDir`) or in a "persistent-claim" way using persistent
volumes.
It's possible to provide the storage configuration in the related ConfigMap using a JSON string as value for the 
`kafka-storage` and `zookeeper-storage` fields.

IMPORTANT: The `kafka-storage` and `zookeeper-storage` fields can't be changed when the cluster is up.

The JSON representation has a mandatory `type` field for specifying the type of storage to use ("ephemeral" or "persistent-claim").

The "ephemeral" storage is really simple to configure and the related JSON string has the following structure.

.Ephemeral storage JSON
[source,json]
----
{ "type": "ephemeral" }

----

WARNING: If the Zookeeper cluster is deployed using "ephemeral" storage, the Kafka brokers can have problems dealing with
Zookeeper node restarts which could happen via updates in the cluster ConfigMap.

In case of "persistent-claim" type the following fields can be provided as well :

* `size`: defines the size of the persistent volume claim (i.e 1Gi) - mandatory
* `class` : the {ProductPlatformName} https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/[storage class] to use
for dynamic volume allocation - optional
* `selector`: allows to select a specific persistent volume to use. It contains a `matchLabels` field which defines an
inner JSON object with key:value representing labels for selecting such a volume - optional
* `delete-claim`: boolean value which specifies if the persistent volume claim has to be deleted when the cluster is un-deployed.
Default is `false` - optional

.Persistent storage JSON with 1Gi as size
[source,json]
----
{ "type": "persistent-claim", "size": "1Gi" }
----

This example demonstrates use of a storage class.

.Persistent storage JSON using "storage class"
[source,json]
----
{
  "type": "persistent-claim",
  "size": "1Gi",
  "class": "my-storage-class"
}
----

Finally, a selector can be used in order to select a specific labeled persistent volume which provides some needed features (i.e. an SSD)

.Persistent storage JSON with "match labels" selector
[source,json]
----
{
  "type": "persistent-claim",
  "size": "1Gi",
  "selector":
  {
    "matchLabels":
    {
      "hdd-type": "ssd"
    }
  },
  "delete-claim": true
}
----

When the "persistent-claim" is used, other than the resources already described in the <<Kafka>> section, the following resources
are generated :

* `data-[cluster-name]-kafka-[idx]` Persistent Volume Claim for the volume used for storing data for the Kafka broker pod `[idx]`
* `data-[cluster-name]-zookeeper-[idx]` Persistent Volume Claim for the volume used for storing data for the
Zookeeper node pod `[idx]`

===== Metrics

Because {ProductName} uses the [JMX exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/jmx_exporter) in order to expose metrics
on each node, the JSON string used for metrics configuration in the cluster ConfigMap reflects the related JMX exporter 
configuration file. For this reason, you can find more information on how to use it in the corresponding GitHub repo.

For more information about using the metrics with Prometheus and Grafana, see <<_metrics>>

[[resources_json_config]]
===== Resource limits and requests

It is possible to configure {ProductPlatformName} resource limits and requests on several containers using a JSON object.
The object may have a `requests` and a `limits` property, each having the same schema, consisting of `cpu` and `memory` properties.
The {ProductPlatformName} syntax is used for the values of `cpu` and `memory`.

.Example Resource limits and requests JSON configuration
[source,json]
----
{
  "requests": {
    "cpu": "1",
    "memory": "2Gi"
  },
  "limits": {
    "cpu": "1",
    "memory": "2Gi"
  }
}
----

:k8s-docs-version: v1-7
:k8s-resource-request-limit-docs-link: https://{k8s-docs-version}.docs.kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-compute-resources-container/

`requests/memory`::
the memory request for the container, corresponding directly to {k8s-resource-request-limit-docs-link}[`spec.containers[\].resources.requests.memory`] setting.
{ProductPlatformName} will ensure the containers have at least this much memory by running the pod on a node with at
least as much free memory as all the containers require. Optional with no default.
`requests/cpu`::
the cpu request for the container, corresponding directly to {k8s-resource-request-limit-docs-link}[`spec.containers[\].resources.requests.cpu`] setting.
{ProductPlatformName} will ensure the containers have at least this much CPU by running the pod on a node with at least
as much uncommitted CPU as all the containers require. Optional with no default.
`limits/memory`::
the memory limit for the container, corresponding directly to {k8s-resource-request-limit-docs-link}[`spec.containers[\].resources.limits.memory`] setting.
{ProductPlatformName} will limit the containers to this much memory, potentially terminating their pod if they use more.
Optional with no default.
`limits/cpu`::
the cpu limit for the container, corresponding directly to {k8s-resource-request-limit-docs-link}[`spec.containers[\].resources.limits.cpu`] setting.
{ProductPlatformName} will cap the containers CPU usage to this limit. Optional with no default.

More details about resource limits and requests can be found on {k8s-resource-request-limit-docs-link}[{KubernetesName} website].

====== Minimum Resource Requirements

Testing has shown that the Cluster Operator functions adequately with 256Mi of memory and 200m CPU when watching two clusters.
It is therefore recommended to use these as a minimum when configuring resource requests and not to run it with lower limits than these.
Configuring more generous limits is recommended, especially when it's controlling multiple clusters.


[[jvm_json_config]]
===== JVM Options

It is possible to configure a subset of available JVM options on Kafka, Zookeeper and Kafka Connect containers using a JSON object.
The object has a property for each JVM (`java`) option which can be configured:

`-Xmx`::
The maximum heap size. See the <<setting_xmx>> section for further details.

`-Xms`::
The initial heap size.
Setting the same value for initial and maximum (`-Xmx`) heap sizes avoids the JVM having to allocate memory after startup,
at the cost of possibly allocating more heap than is really needed. For Kafka and Zookeeper pods such allocation could
cause unwanted latency. For Kafka Connect avoiding over allocation may be the more important concern, especially in
distributed mode where the effects of over-allocation will be multiplied by the number of consumers.

NOTE: The units accepted by JVM settings such as `-Xmx` and `-Xms` are those accepted by the JDK `java`
binary in the corresponding image. Accordingly, `1g` or `1G` means 1,073,741,824 bytes, and `Gi` is not a valid unit
suffix. This is in contrast to the units used for <<resources_json_config,memory limits and requests>>, which follow the
{ProductPlatformName} convention where `1G` means 1,000,000,000 bytes, and `1Gi` means 1,073,741,824 bytes

.Example Resource limits and requests JSON configuration
[source,json]
----
{
  "-Xmx": "2g",
  "-Xms": "2g"
}
----

In the above example, the JVM will use 2 GiB (=2,147,483,648 bytes) for its heap.
Its total memory usage will be approximately 8GiB.

`-server`::
Selects the server JVM. This option can be set to true or false. Optional.

`-XX`::
A JSON Object for configuring advanced runtime options of a JVM. Optional

The `-server` and `-XX` options are used to configure the `KAFKA_JVM_PERFORMANCE_OPTS` option of Apache Kafka.

.Example advanced runtime JVM configuration
[source,json]
----
{
  "-server": true,
  "-XX": {
             "UseG1GC": true,
             "MaxGCPauseMillis": 20,
             "InitiatingHeapOccupancyPercent": 35,
             "ExplicitGCInvokesConcurrent": true,
             "UseParNewGC": false
         }
}
----

The example configuration above will result in the following JVM options:

[source]
----
-server -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=20 -XX:InitiatingHeapOccupancyPercent=35 -XX:+ExplicitGCInvokesConcurrent -XX:-UseParNewGC
----

When neither of the two options (`-server` and `-XX`) is specified, the default Apache Kafka configuration of `KAFKA_JVM_PERFORMANCE_OPTS` will be used.

[[setting_xmx]]
====== Setting `-Xmx`

The default value used for `-Xmx` depends on whether there is a <<resources_json_config,memory limit>> for the container:

* If there is a memory limit, the JVM's maximum memory will be limited according to the kind of pod (Kafka, Zookeeper,
Topic Operator) to an appropriate value less than the limit.
* Otherwise, when there is no memory limit, the JVM's maximum memory will be set according to the kind of pod and the
RAM available to the container.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Setting `-Xmx` explicitly is requires some care:

* The JVM's overall memory usage will be approximately 4 × the maximum heap, as configured by `-Xmx`.

* If `-Xmx` is set without also setting an appropriate {ProductPlatformName}
memory limit, it is possible that the container will be killed should the {ProductPlatformName} node
experience memory pressure (from other Pods running on it).

* If `-Xmx` is set without also setting an appropriate {ProductPlatformName}
memory request, it is possible that the container will scheduled to a node with insufficient memory.
In this case the container will start but crash (immediately if `-Xms` is set to `-Xmx`, or some later time if not).

====

When setting `-Xmx` explicitly, it is recommended to:

* set the memory request and the memory limit to the same value,
* use a memory request that is at least 4.5 × the `-Xmx`,
* consider setting `-Xms` to the same value as `-Xms`.

Furthermore, containers doing lots of disk I/O (such as Kafka broker containers) will need to leave some memory available
for use as operating system page cache. On such containers, the request memory should be substantially more than the
memory used by the JVM.

[[kafka_rack]]
===== Kafka rack

It is possible to enable Kafka rack-awareness (more information can be found on the {KafkaRacks})
by specifying a JSON object for the `kafka-rack` field in the cluster ConfigMap.
The `kafka-rack` JSON object has one mandatory field named `topologyKey`.
This key needs to match one of the labels assigned to the {ProductPlatformName} cluster nodes.
The label is used by {ProductPlatformName} when scheduling Kafka broker pods to nodes.
If the {ProductPlatformName} cluster is running on a cloud provider platform, that label should represent the availability zone where the node is running.
Usually, the nodes are labeled with `failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone` that can be easily used as `topologyKey` value.
This will have the effect of spreading the broker pods across zones, and also setting the brokers `broker.rack` configuration parameter.

.Example Kafka rack JSON configuration
[source,json]
----
{
  "topologyKey": "failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone"
}
----

In the above example, the `failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone` node label will be used for scheduling Kafka broker Pods.

[[affinity]]
===== Node and Pod Affinity

Node and Pod Affinity provide a flexible mechanism to guide the scheduling of pods to nodes by {ProductPlatformName}.
Node affinity can be used so that broker pods are preferentially scheduled to nodes with fast disks, for example.
Similarly, pod affinity could be used to try to schedule Kafka clients on the same nodes as Kafka brokers.
More information can be found on the {K8sAffinity}.

The format of the corresponding key is the same as the content supported in the Pod `affinity` in {ProductPlatformName}, as a string in JSON or YAML format, that is: `nodeAffinity`, `podAffinity` and `podAntiAffinity`.

.Example fragment of a cluster ConfigMap with a nodeAffinity
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: my-cluster
  labels:
    strimzi.io/kind: cluster
    strimzi.io/type: kafka
data:
  ...
  kafka-affinity: |
    nodeAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        nodeSelectorTerms:
        - matchExpressions:
          - key: kubernetes.io/e2e-az-name
            operator: In
            values:
            - e2e-az1
            - e2e-az2
  ...
----

NOTE: When using both `kafka-affinity` and <<kafka_rack,`kafka-rack`>> be aware that `kafka-rack` uses a pod anti-affinity.
This is necessary so that broker pods are scheduled in different failure domains, as specified via the `topologyKey`.
This anti-affinity will not be present in the `kafka-affinity`, but is still present on the StatefulSet and thus will still be considered by the scheduler.

[[topic_operator_json_config]]
===== Topic Operator

Alongside the Kafka cluster and the Zookeeper ensemble, the Cluster Operator can also deploy the topic operator.
In order to do that, the `topic-operator-config` field has to be put into the data section of the cluster ConfigMap.
This field is a JSON string containing the topic operator configuration.
Without this field, the Cluster Operator doesn't deploy the topic operator. It is still possible to deploy the topic
operator by creating appropriate {ProductPlatformName} resources.

The JSON representation of the 'topic-operator-config` has no mandatory fields and if the value is an empty object
(just "{ }"), the Cluster Operator will deploy the topic operator with a default configuration.

The configurable fields are the following :

`image`::
Docker image to use for the topic operator. Default is determined by the value of the
`<<STRIMZI_DEFAULT_TOPIC_operator_IMAGE,STRIMZI_DEFAULT_TOPIC_operator_IMAGE>>` environment variable of the Cluster Operator.
`watchedNamespace`::
The {ProductPlatformName} namespace in which the topic operator watches for topic ConfigMaps. Default is the namespace
where the topic operator is running.
`reconciliationIntervalMs`::
The interval between periodic reconciliations in milliseconds. Default is 900000 (15 minutes).
`zookeeperSessionTimeoutMs`::
The Zookeeper session timeout in milliseconds. Default is 20000 milliseconds (20 seconds).
`topicMetadataMaxAttempts`::
The number of attempts for getting topics metadata from Kafka. The time between each attempt is defined as an exponential
back-off. You might want to increase this value when topic creation could take more time due to its larger size (i.e.
many partitions / replicas). Default is `6`.
`resources`::
An object configuring the resource limits and requests for the topic operator container. The accepted JSON format is
described in the <<resources_json_config>> section.
`affinity`::
Node and Pod affinity for the Topic Operator, as described in the <<affinity>> section.
The format of the corresponding key is the same as the content supported in the Pod `affinity` in {ProductPlatformName}.

==== Kafka Connect

In order to configure a Kafka Connect cluster deployment, it's possible to specify the following fields in the `data` section of 
the related ConfigMap:

`nodes`:: Number of Kafka Connect worker nodes. Default is 1.
`image`:: The Docker image to use for the Kafka Connect workers. Default is determined by the value of the
`<<STRIMZI_DEFAULT_KAFKA_CONNECT_IMAGE,STRIMZI_DEFAULT_KAFKA_CONNECT_IMAGE>>` environment variable of the Cluster Operator.
If S2I is used (only on {OpenShiftName}), then it should be the related S2I image.
`healthcheck-delay`:: The initial delay for the liveness and readiness probes for each Kafka Connect worker node. Default is 60.
`healthcheck-timeout`:: The timeout on the liveness and readiness probes for each Kafka Connect worker node. Default is 5.
`connect-config`:: A JSON string with Kafka Connect configuration. See section <<kafka_connect_configuration_json_config>>
for more details.
`connect-metrics-config`:: A JSON string representing the JMX exporter configuration for exposing metrics from Kafka Connect nodes. Removing this field means having no metrics exposed.
`resources`:: A JSON string configuring the resource limits and requests for Kafka Connect containers.
The accepted JSON format is described in the <<resources_json_config>> section.
`jvmOptions`:: A JSON string allowing the JVM running Kafka Connect to be configured.
The accepted JSON format is described in the <<jvm_json_config>> section.
`affinity`::
Node and Pod affinity for the Kafka Connect pods, as described in the <<affinity>> section.
The format of the corresponding key is the same as the content supported in the Pod `affinity` in {ProductPlatformName}.

The following is an example of a Kafka Connect configuration ConfigMap.

The resources created by the Cluster Operator into the {ProductPlatformName} cluster will be the following :

* [connect-cluster-name]-connect Deployment which is in charge to create the Kafka Connect worker node pods
* [connect-cluster-name]-connect Service which exposes the REST interface for managing the Kafka Connect cluster
* [connect-cluster-name]-connect-metrics-config ConfigMap which contains the Kafka Connect metrics configuration and is mounted as a volume by the Kafka Connect pods

[[kafka_connect_configuration_json_config]]
===== Kafka Connect configuration

The `connect-config` field allows detailed configuration of Apache Kafka Connect and Connect S2I. This field should contain
a JSON object with Kafka Connect configuration options as keys. The values could be in one of the following JSON types:

* String
* Number
* Boolean

The `connect-config` field supports all Kafka Connect configuration options with the exception of options related to:

* Security (Encryption, Authentication and Authorization)
* Listener / REST interface configuration
* Plugin path configuration

Specifically, all configuration options with keys starting with one of the following strings will be ignored:

* `ssl.`
* `sasl.`
* `security.`
* `listeners`
* `plugin.path`
* `rest.`

All other options will be passed to Kafka Connect. A list of all the available options can be found on the
http://kafka.apache.org/11/documentation.html#connectconfigs[Kafka website]. An example `connect-config` field is provided
below.

.Example Kafka Connect configuration
[source,json]
----
{
  "bootstrap.servers": "my-cluster-kafka:9092",
  "group.id": "my-connect-cluster",
  "offset.storage.topic": "my-connect-cluster-offsets",
  "config.storage.topic": "my-connect-cluster-configs",
  "status.storage.topic": "my-connect-cluster-status",
  "key.converter": "org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter",
  "value.converter": "org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter",
  "key.converter.schemas.enable": true,
  "value.converter.schemas.enable": true,
  "internal.key.converter": "org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter",
  "internal.value.converter": "org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter",
  "internal.key.converter.schemas.enable": false,
  "internal.value.converter.schemas.enable": false,
  "config.storage.replication.factor": 3,
  "offset.storage.replication.factor": 3,
  "status.storage.replication.factor": 3
}
----

Selected options have default values:

* `group.id` with default value `connect-cluster`
* `offset.storage.topic` with default value `connect-cluster-offsets`
* `config.storage.topic` with default value `connect-cluster-configs`
* `status.storage.topic` with default value `connect-cluster-status`
* `key.converter` with default value `org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter`
* `value.converter` with default value `org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter`
* `internal.key.converter` with default value `org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter`
* `internal.value.converter` with default value `org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter`
* `internal.key.converter.schemas.enable` with default value `false`
* `internal.value.converter.schemas.enable` with default value `false`

These options will be automatically configured in case they are not present in the `connect-config` field.

INFO:: The Cluster Operator doesn't validate the provided configuration. When invalid configuration is provided, the
Kafka Connect cluster might not start or might become unstable. In such cases, the configuration in the `connect-config` field
should be fixed and the Cluster Operator will roll out the new configuration to all Kafka Connect instances.

===== Kafka Connect S2I deployment

When using {ProductName} together with an {OpenShiftName} cluster, a user can deploy Kafka Connect with support for https://docs.openshift.org/3.9/dev_guide/builds/index.html[{OpenShiftName} Builds] and https://docs.openshift.org/3.9/creating_images/s2i.html#creating-images-s2i[Source-to-Image (S2I)].
To activate the S2I deployment, the `strimzi.io/type` label in the ConfigMap should be set to `kafka-connect-s2i`.
The following is a full example of a ConfigMap for a Kafka Connect S2I cluster.

.Example Kafka Connect S2I cluster ConfigMap
[source,yaml,options="nowrap",subs="attributes"]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: my-connect-cluster
  labels:
    strimzi.io/kind: cluster

data:
  nodes: "1"
  image: "{DockerKafkaConnectS2I}"
  healthcheck-delay: "60"
  healthcheck-timeout: "5"
  connect-config: |-
    {
      "bootstrap.servers": "my-cluster-kafka:9092"
    }
----

The S2I deployment is very similar to the regular Kafka Connect deployment.
Compared to the regular deployment, the Cluster Operator will create the following additional resources:

* [connect-cluster-name]-connect-source ImageStream which is used as the base image for the newly-built Docker images
* [connect-cluster-name]-connect BuildConfig which is responsible for building the new Kafka Connect Docker images
* [connect-cluster-name]-connect ImageStream where the newly built Docker images will be pushed
* [connect-cluster-name]-connect DeploymentConfig which is in charge of creating the Kafka Connect worker node pods
* [connect-cluster-name]-connect Service which exposes the REST interface for managing the Kafka Connect cluster

The Kafka Connect S2I deployment supports the same options as the regular Kafka Connect deployment.
A list of supported options can be found in the <<kafka_connect_config_map_details>> section.
The `image` option specifies the Docker image which will be used as the _source image_ - the base image for the newly built Docker image.
The default value of the `image` option is determined by the value of the `<<STRIMZI_DEFAULT_KAFKA_CONNECT_S2I_IMAGE,STRIMZI_DEFAULT_KAFKA_CONNECT_S2I_IMAGE>>` environment variable of the Cluster Operator.
All other options have the same meaning as for the regular deployment.

Once the Kafka Connect S2I cluster is deployed, new plugins can be added by starting a new {OpenShiftName} build.
Before starting the build, a directory with all the KafkaConnect plugins which should be added has to be created.
The plugins and all their dependencies can be in a single directory or can be split into multiple subdirectories.
For example:

[source,shell]

----

A new build can be started using the following command:

[source,shell]
oc start-build my-connect-cluster-connect --from-dir ./s2i-plugins/

This command will upload the whole directory into the {OpenShiftName} cluster and start a new build.
The build will take the base Docker image from the source ImageStream (named _[connect-cluster-name]-connect-source_) and add the directory and all the files it contains into this image and push the resulting image into the target ImageStream (named _[connect-cluster-name]-connect_).
When the new image is pushed to the target ImageStream, a rolling update of the Kafka Connect S2I deployment will be started and will roll out the new version of the image with the added plugins.
By default, the `oc start-build` command will trigger the build and complete.
The progress of the build can be observed in the {OpenShiftName} console.
Alternatively, the option `--follow` can be used to follow the build from the command line:

[source,shell]
----
oc start-build my-connect-cluster-connect --from-dir ./s2i-plugins/ --follow
Uploading directory "s2i-plugins" as binary input for the build ...

----

NOTE: The S2I build will always add the additional Kafka Connect plugins to the original source image.
They will not be added to the Docker image from a previous build.
To add multiple plugins to the deployment, they all have to be added within the same build.


=== Provisioning Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for the operator

For the operator to function it needs permission within the {ProductPlatformName} cluster to interact with
the resources it manages (ConfigMaps, Pods, Deployments, StatefulSets, Services etc).
Such permission is described in terms of {ProductPlatformName} role-based access controls.

==== Using a ServiceAccount

The operator is best run using a ServiceAccount:

[source,yaml,options="nowrap"]
.Example ServiceAccount for the Cluster Operator
----
include::examples/install/cluster-operator/01-service-account.yaml[]
----

The Deployment of the operator then needs to specify this in the `serviceAccountName` of its `template`´s
 `spec`:

[source,yaml,numbered,options="nowrap",highlight='12']
.Partial example Deployment for the Cluster Operator
----
include::examples/install/cluster-operator/07-deployment.yaml[lines=1..13]
# etc ...
----

Note line 12, where the the `strimzi-cluster-operator` ServiceAccount is specified as the `serviceAccountName`.

If the rack awareness feature is used, a Kafka init container will be started before the broker container in order to enable it.
The application inside this container is best run using a ServiceAccount:

[source,yaml,options="nowrap"]
.Example ServiceAccount for the Kafka init container
----
include::examples/install/cluster-operator/04-service-account-kafka.yaml[]
----

The Cluster Operator will be in charge of configuring this ServiceAccount as `serviceAccountName` for the Kafka init container during cluster deployment.

==== Defining a Role

The Cluster Operator needs to operate using a Role that gives it access to the necessary resources.
Depending on the {ProductPlatformName} cluster setup, a cluster administrator might be needed to create the Role.
Cluster administrator rights are only needed for the creation of the Role.
The Role itself doesn't contain any cluster administrator privileges, and the Cluster Operator will not run under the cluster admin account.
The Role follows the "principle of least privilege" and contains only those privileges needed by the Cluster Operator to operate Kafka, Kafka Connect and Zookeeper clusters.
The assigned privileges allow the Cluster Operator to manage {ProductPlatformName} resources such as StatefulSets, Deployments, Pods and ConfigMaps.

[source,yaml,options="nowrap"]
.Example Role for the Cluster Operator
----
include::examples/install/cluster-operator/02-role.yaml[]
----

When the Role cannot be created, the predefined ClusterRole named `edit` can be used instead.

If the rack awareness feature is used, the started Kafka init container needs to operate using a ClusterRole that gives it access to the necessary resources.

[source,yaml,options="nowrap"]
.Example Role for the Kafka init container
----
include::examples/install/cluster-operator/05-role-kafka.yaml[]
----

The assigned privileges allow the Kafka init container to get Nodes information.

==== Defining a RoleBinding

Finally, the operator needs a RoleBinding which associates its Role with its ServiceAccount:

[source,yaml,options="nowrap"]
.Example RoleBinding for the Cluster Operator
----
include::examples/install/cluster-operator/03-role-binding.yaml[]
----

In case the `edit` ClusterRole is being used, the RoleBinding has to be modified to refer to it instead of the `strimzi-cluster-operator-role` Role:

[source,yaml,options="nowrap"]
.Example RoleBinding for the Cluster Operator using the `edit` ClusterRole
----
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: strimzi-cluster-operator-binding
  labels:
    app: strimzi
subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: strimzi-cluster-operator
roleRef:
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: edit
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
----

If the rack awareness feature is used, the Kafka init container needs a ClusterRoleBinding which associates its ClusterRole with its ServiceAccount:

[source,yaml,options="nowrap"]
.Example ClusterRoleBinding for the Kafka init container
----
include::examples/install/cluster-operator/06-role-binding-kafka.yaml[]
----

It's important to highlight that the `namespace` field, specified in the ServiceAccount subject, needs to be the same namespace where the Kafka cluster will be deployed.

=== Operator configuration

The operator itself can be configured through the following environment variables.

[[STRIMZI_NAMESPACE]] `STRIMZI_NAMESPACE`:: Required. A comma-separated list of namespaces that the operator should
operate in. The Cluster Operator deployment might use the https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/downward-api-volume-expose-pod-information/#the-downward-api[{KubernetesName} Downward API]
to set this automatically to the namespace the Cluster Operator is deployed in. See the example below:
+
[source,yaml,options="nowrap"]
----
env:
  - name: STRIMZI_NAMESPACE
    valueFrom:
      fieldRef:
        fieldPath: metadata.namespace
----

[[STRIMZI_FULL_RECONCILIATION_INTERVAL_MS]] `STRIMZI_FULL_RECONCILIATION_INTERVAL_MS`:: Optional, default: 120000 ms. The interval between periodic reconciliations, in milliseconds.


[[STRIMZI_OPERATION_TIMEOUT_MS]] `STRIMZI_OPERATION_TIMEOUT_MS`:: Optional, default: 300000 ms. The timeout for internal operations, in milliseconds. This value should be
increased when using {ProductName} on clusters where regular {ProductPlatformName} operations take longer than usual (because of slow downloading of Docker images, for example).

[[STRIMZI_DEFAULT_KAFKA_IMAGE]] `STRIMZI_DEFAULT_KAFKA_IMAGE`:: Optional, default `strimzi/kafka:latest`.
The image name to use as a default when deploying Kafka, if
no image is specified as the `kafka-image` in the <<kafka_config_map_details,Kafka cluster ConfigMap>>.

[[STRIMZI_DEFAULT_INIT_KAFKA_IMAGE]] `STRIMZI_DEFAULT_INIT_KAFKA_IMAGE`:: Optional, default `strimzi/init-kafka:latest`.
The image name to use as default for the init container started before the broker for doing initial configuration work (i.e. rack support), if
no image is specified as the `init-kafka-image` in the <<kafka_config_map_details,Kafka cluster ConfigMap>>.

[[STRIMZI_DEFAULT_KAFKA_CONNECT_IMAGE]] `STRIMZI_DEFAULT_KAFKA_CONNECT_IMAGE`:: Optional, default `strimzi/kafka-connect:latest`.
The image name to use as a default when deploying Kafka Connect, if
no image is specified as the `image` in the
<<kafka_connect_config_map_details,Kafka Connect cluster ConfigMap>>.

[[STRIMZI_DEFAULT_KAFKA_CONNECT_S2I_IMAGE]] `STRIMZI_DEFAULT_KAFKA_CONNECT_S2I_IMAGE`:: Optional, default `strimzi/kafka-connect-s2i:latest`.
The image name to use as a default when deploying Kafka Connect S2I, if
no image is specified as the `image` in the cluster ConfigMap.

[[STRIMZI_DEFAULT_TOPIC_OPERATOR_IMAGE]] `STRIMZI_DEFAULT_TOPIC_OPERATOR_IMAGE`:: Optional, default `strimzi/topic-operator:latest`.
The image name to use as a default when deploying the topic operator, if
no image is specified as the `image` in the <<topic_operator_json_config,topic operator config>>
of the Kafka cluster ConfigMap.

[[STRIMZI_DEFAULT_ZOOKEEPER_IMAGE]] `STRIMZI_DEFAULT_ZOOKEEPER_IMAGE`:: Optional, default `strimzi/zookeeper:latest`.
The image name to use as a default when deploying Zookeeper, if
no image is specified as the `zookeeper-image` in the <<kafka_config_map_details,Kafka cluster ConfigMap>>.

[[STRIMZI_LOG_LEVEL]] `STRIMZI_LOG_LEVEL`:: Optional, default `INFO`.
The level for printing logging messages. The value can be set to: `ERROR`, `WARNING`, `INFO`, `DEBUG` and `TRACE`.

[[multi-namespace]]
==== Watching multiple namespaces

The `STRIMZI_NAMESPACE` environment variable can be used to configure a single operator instance
to operate in multiple namespaces. For each namespace given, the operator will watch for cluster ConfigMaps
and perform periodic reconciliation. To be able to do this, the operator's ServiceAccount needs
access to the necessary resources in those other namespaces. This can be done by creating an additional
RoleBinding in each of those namespaces, associating the operator's ServiceAccount
(`strimzi-cluster-operator` in the examples) with the operator's
Role (`strimzi-operator-role` in the examples).

Suppose, for example, that a operator deployed in namespace `foo` needs to operate in namespace `bar`.
The following RoleBinding would grant the necessary permissions:

.Example RoleBinding for a operator to operate in namespace `bar`
